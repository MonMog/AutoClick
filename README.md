# AutoClick
A very simple python script that makes you click really fast, like I mean over 1000 clicks per second fast, want to try it out? check my other websites to measure it!
IMPORTANT: Since there is no button to disable it, if you want to stop clicking, you need to make sure the failsafe is not tampered with and quickly move your mouse into the top left corner of your screen. I will work on making a button to disable the clicking

nvm lol it was 2 lines of code to add
